## Implementation approach
We will use Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework, for building the web application. We will use SQLAlchemy as the ORM for database operations. For the frontend, we will use Bootstrap for responsive design and JQuery for handling user interactions. We will use Twilio for implementing the notification system. The application will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The difficult point is to ensure the smooth communication between residents, visitors, and security personnel, and to handle the approval process efficiently.

## Python package name
```python
"resident_visit_management"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "views.py",
    "controllers.py",
    "templates/home.html",
    "templates/schedule_visit.html",
    "templates/manage_visit.html",

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class Resident{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str phone_number
        +str email
        +__init__(id: int, name: str, phone_number: str, email: str)
        +schedule_visit(visitor: Visitor)
        +approve_visit(visit: Visit)
    }
    class Visitor{
        +int id
        +str name
        +str phone_number
        +str nic
        +str vehicle_number
        +__init__(id: int, name: str, phone_number: str, nic: str, vehicle_number: str)
    }
    class Visit{
        +int id
        +datetime scheduled_time
        +bool is_approved
        +Resident resident
        +Visitor visitor
        +__init__(id: int, scheduled_time: datetime, is_approved: bool, resident: Resident, visitor: Visitor)
    }
    class Security{
        +int id
        +str name
        +__init__(id: int, name: str)
        +search_visit(visitor: Visitor)
        +create_visit(visitor: Visitor, resident: Resident)
    }
    Resident "1" -- "*" Visit: schedules
    Visitor "1" -- "*" Visit: visits
    Security "1" -- "*" Visit: manages
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant R as Resident
    participant V as Visitor
    participant S as Security
    participant Vi as Visit
    R->>V: schedule_visit(visitor)
    Note over R,V: Visit is scheduled
    S->>V: search_visit(visitor)
    Note over S,V: Visit is found
    R->>Vi: approve_visit(visit)
    Note over R,Vi: Visit is approved
    S->>Vi: create_visit(visitor, resident)
    Note over S,Vi: Actual visit is created
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
