## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("models.py", "Implement Resident, Visitor, Visit, and Security classes"),
    ("controllers.py", "Implement functions for scheduling, approving, searching, and creating visits"),
    ("views.py", "Implement Flask routes for the functions in controllers.py"),
    ("main.py", "Initialize Flask app and database, import routes from views.py"),
    ("templates/home.html", "Design the homepage"),
    ("templates/schedule_visit.html", "Design the visit scheduling page"),
    ("templates/manage_visit.html", "Design the visit managing page"),
    ("static/css/main.css", "Write CSS for the web pages"),
    ("static/js/main.js", "Write JavaScript for handling user interactions on the web pages")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "models.py",
    "controllers.py",
    "views.py",
    "main.py",
    "templates/home.html",
    "templates/schedule_visit.html",

```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'models.py' file contains the classes for the main entities in the application: Resident, Visitor, Visit, and Security. Each class has its own attributes and methods.

The 'controllers.py' file contains the functions for scheduling, approving, searching, and creating visits. These functions use the classes defined in 'models.py'.

The 'views.py' file contains the Flask routes for the functions in 'controllers.py'. These routes are the endpoints that the frontend will interact with.

The 'main.py' file initializes the Flask app and the database, and imports the routes from 'views.py'.

The 'templates' directory contains the HTML files for the web pages. 'home.html' is the homepage, 'schedule_visit.html' is the visit scheduling page, and 'manage_visit.html' is the visit managing page.

The 'static/css' directory contains the CSS file for the web pages. 'main.css' is the main CSS file.

The 'static/js' directory contains the JavaScript file for handling user interactions on the web pages. 'main.js' is the main JavaScript file.

```

## Anything UNCLEAR
There is no main entry point specified in the PRD/technical design. I assume 'main.py' is the main entry point of the application. Also, the initialization of third-party libraries is not specified. I assume they will be initialized in 'main.py'.
